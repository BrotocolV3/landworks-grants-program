# LandWorks Open Scenes Grant Program


EnterDAO is a decentralized organization on the Ethereum blockchain with the vision to build products enabling new markets within the metaverse economy. Leveraging the full power of the metaverse economy involves renting and leasing of metaverse land. This is already made possible by LandWorks. The next step in our journey  is allowing users/companies/brands/DAOs to deploy meaningful digital experiences within the metaverse.

Bringing creators to the metaverse economy is a fundamental piece to how Landworks and EnterDAO will grow. As we empower more artists, we will in turn grow as well and increase our reach and potential to make further impact.

That’s why we are introducing the first iteration of LandWork’s Open Scene Grant Program.


**What?**

The Open Scene Grant Program is a grant program for building Decentraland Scenes in several categories. The program is funded by the EnterDAO treasury after the successful pass of the DAO’s first governance proposal. All scenes funded through the Open Scenes Grant Program will be open-sourced and available to the public for anyone to use. This is the first round of the program and if successful many more are coming with the goal of enabling existing and new users to easily generate a variety of experiences on their rented or owned land.   


**Why?**

As more people are exposed to the metaverse we are noticing a need for quality scenes being available to the public for hosting events, displaying their art or just having fun. Many metaverse newcomers have limited knowledge about scene development, therefore this limits creators from experimenting with various use cases and slows down the growth and development of the metaverse. Our renting platform, LandWorks, provides an easy and affordable means of accessing metaverse land, however the availability of quality scenes/buildings are not widespread, transparent, or accessible. That’s what we aim to solve with this Open Scene Grant Program - the generated builds/assets will allow for anyone to have access to quality Decentraland scenes for their event/gallery/show and at the same time empower builders to amaze everyone with their creativity. Creators will have less hesitance with experimenting across various use cases, or sizes of spaces, in turn creating a “Wow” effect no matter where you go in the metaverse.


**How?**

For this first round of the grant program the grant pool will be 50,000 USDC + 50,000 ENTR (vested over 50 weeks) given in 1:1 ratio. That would mean that whatever sum you get in USDC, it will be matched in ENTR tokens. The idea for the vested ENTR is for builders to have vested interest in the DAO and its protocols over time. 

Grants may be requested for any amount within one of two possible tiers, regardless of the grant category.

- Tier 1 - up to 2,500 USDC + 2,500 ENTR tokens
- Tier 2 - up to 10,000 USDC + 2,500 ENTR tokens

We have decided to have two tiers in order to cater to builders who are in the beginning of their building journeys (Tier 1) and also to more professional builders or studios (Tier 2).


Categories:
- NFT gallery / shop - enabling users to showcase and sell their tokens.
- Event venue for conferences / webinars / lectures / parties - enabling users to livestream and display content.
- Venue for a fashion runway show - enabling users to showcase wearables.
- Company HQ - a multipurpose venue allowing brands to establish a metaverse presence
- Sharded Minds themed scene - If you ever wanted to build something unique in Decentraland - this is your chance. Might be a place of worship to pray for green candles, a sculpture to commemorate Vitalik, a representation of your favorite Sharded Mind or anything else your heart desires. The only requirement is that it should be related somehow to our NFT collection Sharded Minds.

All scenes need to :
- be suited for a 1x1 Land or a 2x2 Estates. If a submission has both sizes it will be extra points but at least one of the sizes is mandatory.
- have the ability to add custom text / branding / links so they can be reused by different parties/users.
- have accompanying documentation for any variable changes or details around deployment.



**Process**

When applying for a grant please state:
- Category of choice (NFT gallery / Event Venue / Fashion Venue / Company HQ / Sharded Minds themed scene)
- Specification and functionalities of the scene (description of your vision and how you plan to execute it)
- Initial design/mock up of the scene (images / models)
- Delivery date (estimate)
- Tier and amount requested from the fund 
- Email / Twitter / Discord
- Wallet for payout (on the Ethereum blockchain)
- Confirmation that you have read and agree with the terms and conditions of the program.

Link to application form: https://d1zs47v7suw.typeform.com/to/hs05sYCZ 

After an application is submitted the jury panel will evaluate it and provide a go/no go decision. This includes the vote of the EnterDAO community as well. 

The evaluation period will be up to 20 days and might include a discussion with the builder to further clarify details regarding the submission. Builders will be notified about the decision of the jury panel in any case.

If the application is approved by the jury panel then the builders will be paid upon delivery and successful test of the scene.

This effort is made to put more resources into the hands of our community creators. In such, If the application is denied by the jury panel the builder is still free to build a scene and open-source it through LandWorks, however the builder will not receive a grant for it.

The jury will evaluate the application in a first come, first serve manner, meaning that the application process will close as soon as the jury has approved applications which are exhausting the full amount of the grant prize pool.

Each approved scene should be uploaded in the EnterDAO GitHub repository which we have created for all scenes part of the program.

All scenes will also be available in LandWorks’s scene pool later on as it is currently under development.



**Jury panel and scoring**

The jury panel consists of:

1. Zhivko Todorov (@zhivkoto) - EnterDAO’s co-founder and lead of business development
2. Radina Talonova (@radina_nt) - EnterDAO’s co-founder and product lead for MetaPortal
3. Ivan Iliyanov (@vankiz_) - LandWorks’ design lead
4. Mark Ward (@markwardbro) - DAO Operations Manager at Universe
5. EnterDAO Community - Every ENTR Token holder and Sharded Minds holder with a claimed role in the Discord server will have the opportunity to vote. Each submission will be presented to the community in our Discord server. Eligible users will vote YAY or NAY and the result of the vote will be counted as the fifth overall vote for the build alongside the other 4 jury members. The voting will take place in a dedicated channel in the EnterDAO Discord server.


The scoring will be based on several factors:
- Quality - professional high-quality builds would be scored higher 
- Interactiveness - highly interactive scenes would be scored higher
- Originality - original and creative scenes would be scored higher





**FAQ**

*Can I build a scene for another metaverse (ex. The Sandbox, Voxels)?*<br>
No. For the first iteration of the Open Scenes Grant Program we will fund only Decentraland scenes. Based on what’s the response we could open a second iteration of the program for other metaverses.


*Can I submit an already developed scene?*<br>
Yes. If you have created a quality scene for Decentraland prior to the announcement of the Open Scenes Grant program you can submit it. You would need to agree that the scene will become open-sourced and available for the general public.


*Will the users be able to customize the scenes?*<br>
Yes. As the scenes are going to be open-sourced, that would mean that users would be able to do changes. LandWorks would work on providing a guide for doing basic changes to the scenes like name, links and images within the scene.


*Can I submit a scene for more than 1 category?*<br>
Yes. All applications will be reviewed by our jury panel and assessed based on the scene quality, functionality and usability. 

*Can we participate in the program as a team/company?*<br>
Yes. Whether you are a solo builder, a team of several builders, a company or a DAO - all submissions are welcomed!

*Can I participate with a build done in Decentranalnd’s Builder?*<br>
Yes you can. However you need to keep in mind that quality of the build is one of the scoring criteria of the jury panel therefore you would need to put in extra effort if you are using Decentraland’s Builder.

*How will the payout happen?*<br>
The payout will happen after delivery and successful test of the scene. Funds will be transferred to the provided wallet in the application form.

*Can more than 1 scene in the same category win a grant?*<br>
Yes. Grants are not limited to the categories. Grants will be given out until the prize pool is exhausted.

*How can I vote on the submissions?*<br>
If you have claimed a discord role “ENTR HodLers” or “Sharded Minds” by 3-August-2022, you will be eligible to vote on the grant submissions within a dedicated channel in the EnterDAO discord.

*Can the community vote overrule the decision of the 4 jury members?*<br>
No. The community vote is considered as a fifth vote for the final decision on whether or not a submission will be awarded a grant. The count of the votes only determines where is a go or no-go for the particular submission.
